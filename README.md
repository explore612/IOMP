Title: Project Similarity Detection

Abstract: This project aims to develop a detection model to assess the uniqueness of project titles by determining their similarity to existing titles in a database. The model utilizes advanced semantic similarity detection techniques to compare a user-submitted project title against a repository of previously recorded titles. By leveraging pre-trained language models to generate semantic embeddings, the system calculates similarity scores like Cosine similarity or Euclidean distance and identifies potential duplicates or closely related titles. The approach ensures that new project titles are screened for redundancy and relevance, helping to maintain a distinct and original set of project ideas. This model integrates a backend service with a user-friendly interface, enabling efficient and accurate similarity checks in realtime.
