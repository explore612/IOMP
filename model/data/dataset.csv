To achieve high accuracy and low time complexity, the proposed system implemented using CNN Machine Learning models."
40,PARKINSON DISEASE DETECTION USING SPIRAL IMAGES,"Parkinson’s Disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder, which is characterized by Various symptoms. progressive neurodegenerative disorder affects nervous system in the elderly, which is characterized by motor symptoms such as tremor, rigidity, slowness of movement and problems with gait. In this work, an attempt has been made to classify the spiral images of healthy control and Parkinson’s disease subjects using deep learning neural network. The Vision based Convolutional Neural Network architecture is used to refine the diagnosis of neurodegenerative disorder disease"
41,WildTrackAI – Applies Computer Vision to Animal Footprint Classification,"This Project propose animal identification system that employs image processing techniques. Firstly, the collected footprint images are pre-processed. Images are converted into gray-scale and boundaries of image are determined using canny algorithm. Further, footprint images are segmented. Gabour filter are used to extract features of segmented image. After feature extraction, features are reduced based on unsupervised model. Then reduced feature vectors are inputted into the classification model.Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN)is used for classification and identifying the animal class."
42,Secure Land Registry System using Blockchain,"We present a framework that could be used for the implementation of blockchain technology in land registration sector for Land Records. The aim of our proposed framework is firstly to implement blockchain technology for Land Records and secondly to provide secure storage of electronic records by defining Chain access rules for the land users of the proposed framework. Moreover, this project provides the scalability problem faced by the blockchain technology in general via use of chain storage of the records. This project provides the Land Records system with the benefits of having a scalable, secure and integral blockchain-based solution."
43,Diabetic Retinopathy Prediction using Machine Learning,´Diabetic Retinopathy is the most common cause of vision loss among people with diabetes and the leading cause of vision impairment and blindness among working-age adults. ´By using a certain algorithm the retinal image from the user is fed into system. ´The blood vessels are extracted from the image then it is pre-processed by filtering and segmentation process. ´ It is followed by fractional edge reduction which is used for the feature extraction and by using a Faster retinal convolutional neural network algorithm to automate the diagnosis process. ´It improves the resultant accuracy and by this classification technique we can achieve high accuracy.
44,Fake Job Post Detection using Machine Learning,"To avoid fraudulent post for job in the internet, an automated tool using machine learning based classification techniques is proposed in the project. Different classifiers are used for checking fraudulent post in the web and the results of those classifiers are compared for identifying the best employment scam detection model. It helps in detecting fake job posts from an enormous number of posts. Two major types of classifiers, such as single classifier and ensemble classifiers are considered for fraudulent job posts detection. However, experimental results indicate that ensemble classifiers are the best classification to detect scams over the single classifiers."
